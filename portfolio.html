    <h2>Brief:</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio. Or as I like to call it, bragging-space. As expected of any competent Computer Sciences student,
         I am employing the tools of my trade to form a collection for any interested individual to see. Without further ado, here we go.
    </p>
    
    <h3>My mission:</h3>
    <p>
        To cultivate my interest in computers and their working to produce a <em>tool</em> that may be useful to someone 
        in the future, maybe even you or me.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Projects:</h3>
