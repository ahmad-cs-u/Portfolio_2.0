    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Ahmad, a passionate Computer Science student with a deep fascination for solving complex problems through code. 
        My journey in technology began when I wrote my first "Hello World" program, and since then, I've been hooked on the endless possibilities of programming.
    </p>
    
    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>
        Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I've developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, 
        and software engineering principles. I thrive in environments where I can apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
    <p>
        When I'm not debugging or building projects, you can find me:
        <ul>
            <li>Exploring new technologies in the AI/ML space</li>
            <li>Contributing to open-source projects</li>
            <li>Participating in hackathons and coding challenges</li>
            <li>Mentoring junior developers</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
        I believe in <em>"learning by building"</em> - that the best way to master any technology is to create something tangible with it. 
        This portfolio is a testament to that philosophy, showcasing projects where I've pushed my boundaries and learned new skills.
